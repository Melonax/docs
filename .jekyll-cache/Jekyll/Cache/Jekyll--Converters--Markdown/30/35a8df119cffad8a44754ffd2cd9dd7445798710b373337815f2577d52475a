<p>Stream Deck 
Stream Deck is where you press all the buttons you previously created in the Receiver.</p>

<h3 id="pc-version">PC Version</h3>
<p>Desktop version of Stream Deck can be found at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lioranboard/LioranBoard Stream deck(PC)</code> folder.  <br />
Once launched, you will see settings for IP and Port which should be left at default.   <br />
Selected deck is the deck number you want to connect to.</p>
