<p>Blocks a button by its ID or an entire Group ID.<br />
Wonâ€™t cancel an ongoing button but will prevent any already existing queue from happening when its turn comes.<br />
The block does not persist when LioranBoard is restarted.<br />
By setting the ID to all you can remove all current blocks. This only works for unblocking buttons.</p>
