<p>Execute a command line command just like you do in Command Prompt. Only one line of code.<br />
If LioranBoard is running as admin, commands you perform will also run as admin.<br />
If you want to execute more than one line of code or the command is not executed properly, convert it to a batch file and use Execute program command instead.</p>

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
   You can use <code>|clip</code> at the end of your command to copy the result to your clipboard and then use Load Clipboard command to load it into LioranBoard.
