<p>This command lets you add a cooldown to a button, artificially increasing the duration of the button and preventing it from triggering again.<br />
This is a useful command if you want to make sure your notification alerts do not overlap or if you want to prevent viewers from triggering your buttons over and over again without any cooldown in between.</p>

      <td>Overtime Duration (ms)</td>
      <td>Int</td>
      <td>The amount of time the overtime (cooldown) should last. &lt;br&gt; The countdown starts as soon as the button is triggered.</td>
