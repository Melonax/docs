<p>Sets the position of the read/write head of a buffer.<br />
When you write or read from a buffer, data is not reshuffled. Rather, the head pointer is adjusted.<br />
Whenever you use Buffer: Write command, head pointer advances. Whenever you use Buffer: Read command, head pointer also advances.</p>

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
   Setting the position to a non existing value will result in an error when trying to write or read the buffer in your next command.
