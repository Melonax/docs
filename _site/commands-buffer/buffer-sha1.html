<p>Returns the SHA1 hash from a buffer. The data will be analyzed from 0 to the size of the buffer.<br />
SHA1 hash is like a file’s digital signature. You can verify a file’s integrity by checking its hash value. If even one byte in the file changes (i.e. the file is modified in any way), its hash value will be different.<br />
Very useful command to periodically detect for any file changes.</p>
