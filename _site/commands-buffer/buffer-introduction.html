<p>A buffer is basically a space within the system memory that is used to store small packets of data for just about anything. Since it is held in system memory, it is very fast to access. You can think of it as a temporary place to put things that need to be worked on or processed.</p>

<p>Buffers are created by allocating a space in the system memory, calculated in bytes <a href="#" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="A byte is the unit most computers use to represent a character such as a letter, number or typographic symbol." class="optionTooltip" data-bs-html="true" data-original-title="A byte is the unit most computers use to represent a character such as a letter, number or typographic symbol."><i class="far fa-question-circle fa-lg"></i></a>, which is then reserved for your application as long as it is running or until you delete the buffer.</p>
