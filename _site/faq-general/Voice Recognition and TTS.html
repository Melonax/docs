<p><strong>Default Text to Speech</strong><br />
There’s a default TTS extension when you install LioranBoard Notification System. Transmitter must run in a browser outside of OBS for the TTS to properly work.</p>

<p><strong>Polly Text to Speech</strong><br />
I have created a more advanced extension Polly TTS which works with Transmitter running in OBS as a dock.<br />
You can download Polly TTS from Itch.io below, which is a popular platform for developers to host their indie games and tools.</p>

<strong>Voice Recognition</strong> <br />
Not implemented as of now, however we’re looking into adding it to LioranBoard 2, which is currently in progress!</p>
