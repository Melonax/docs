<p>Set the Transition Bar position (in Studio Mode).<br />
If you need to perform multiple successive T-Bar moves (e.g. : in an animation, or in response to a user moving a T-Bar control in your User Interface), set release to false and execute Release Transition Bar command later once the animation/interaction is over.</p>
