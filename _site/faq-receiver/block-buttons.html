<p>You can use  <a href="">Block Button </a> command to temporarily block a button from executing.<br />
 If you enable <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Allow Queue</code>, all the incoming triggers will be savely queued up and executed as soon as you use Block Button command again to unblock the button.<br />
This is extremely useful if you want to make sure you don’t miss any alerts while you’re on a BRB scene.</p>
