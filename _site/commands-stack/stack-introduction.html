<p>Stack is a special variable which can hold more than one value at a time. It works similar to an array in other programming languages.<br />
If you have a list of items (for example viewer names), storing them in single variables would look like this:</p>
<ul>
  <li>var name1 = “Lioran”</li>
  <li>var name2 = “Neverwho”</li>
  <li>
    <p>var name3 = “Daryl”
This seems quite inefficient if you happen to have a lot of names to store. The answer is to store them all in a stack, which can hold many values under a single name and you can access them by referring to an index number: stack <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">names = ["Lioran", "Neverwho", "Daryl"]</code>.<br />
If you want to retrieve a specific value from a stack, you can use the following formatting: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[position]stackname</code>. Going by the example above, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[2]names</code> would retrieve <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'Neverwho'</code>. [position] can also contain other variables or complex math.<br />
Stack values can be viewed by pressing Tab in the main Receiver menu and typing the full name of the stack.<br />
One thing to note is that a stack is cleared every time you close or reset Receiver. If you wish to save it, you can use Stack: Stringify and File: Save String commands.</p>
