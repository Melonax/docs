<p>Transitions a variable (number) from a starting value to a final value over a given duration.<br />
This command can act as a timer to trigger other commands or buttons.<br />
For example, if you set the start value to 10, final value to 0 and duration to 10000ms (=10 seconds), it will decrease the value by 1 every second and reach 0 after exactly 10 seconds.</p>

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
   Variable will stop transitioning if the button it was triggered with is cleared.
  </div>
