<p>This command lets you join any Twitch chat channel.<br />
You do not need to use this command to join your own channel as long as itâ€™s linked to your LioranBoard, as it will join the chat automatically as soon as you launch Transmitter.</p>

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
   Use this command to join any alternate accounts you have linked to LioranBoard and wish to listen to the chat traffic on.
  </div>
