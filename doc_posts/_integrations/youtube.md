{% include alert.html text="YouTube Live is a <strong>completely new integration</strong> that we have been working on hard to bring to you! <br> Please note it's still in <strong>alpha phase</strong> and there might be bugs. <br> Feel free to report any issues in <i>#bug-report</i> channel in our official <a href='https://discord.gg/dXez8Zh'><strong>LioranBoard Discord server.</strong></a>" type="info" %} 

#### Download and install
LioranBoard YouTube Live is not a native integration in LioranBoard, but rather an extension made by [Christina K](https://github.com/christinna9031?tab=repositories).\
It can be downloaded from Itch.io, which is a platform for developers to share their indie games and tools.

Once you have downloaded the zip file, extract it. You will see the following files: 
- `transmitter_youtube.html` - this is your new Transmitter to use with YouTube Live.\
  Read [How to Run Transmitter]() if this is your first time using LioranBoard
- `youtube_live.lbe` - this is your YouTube Live extension file. Please follow our guide on [How to install an extension](). Make sure you select `transmitter_youtube.html` to install it in.

{% include alert.html text="<code>transmitter_youtube.html</code> does not contain any Twitch related integrations. If you wish to regularly switch between streaming on YouTube Live and Twitch, add both Transmitters to your OBS dock and swap between them." type="warning" %}

<!---
**Why is YouTube Live not completely free like other integrations**\
YouTube Live has a very strict policy when it comes to allowing 3rd party applications to connect and control your stream.\
There are daily **quota limits** applied to all users using the extension that took a long time to negotiate with YouTube.\
We want for everyone to use the integration in a way that allows us to make sure there is enough daily quota for all our users.\
In the future the integration might become free if YouTube provides us with a higher quota.
