Returns a variable with a random value (number) between minimum and maximum possible value.\
This is a basic command you can use for showing random images, playing random videos/sounds, picking a random viewer from chat etc.\
If you wish to have more power over randomizing values (like adding weights), it is best to use Stacks instead.
