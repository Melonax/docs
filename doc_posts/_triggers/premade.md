LioranBoard has some very useful premade triggers.     
For example, you can make your buttons automatically trigger every time you start LioranBoard or every time your LioranBoard connects to Transmitter. 

##### Attach a premade trigger to a button 
You can attach a premade trigger by right clicking on a button - Add/Edit Twitch Triggers, clicking on the + sign and selecting Extension trigger.
