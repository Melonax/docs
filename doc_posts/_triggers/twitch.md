LioranBoard can listen to Twitch events and automatically execute your buttons. For example, it can automatically trigger a button every time you get a new subscriber. 

##### Add a new trigger 
1. Right click on the button in your Receiver - Add Twitch Triggers. 
2. Click on the `+` button and select the trigger type. 
4. Optionally check `Add to Request Queue`, which acts as a button queue. If there is another trigger event while the button is still active (for example if you get two subscribers at the same time), it will place is in the queue and reactivate the button as soon as it's ready again.
5. In your button commands, use [Math: Trigger Pull]({{ "commands/trigger#mathtriggerpull" | relative_url }}) command to retrieve all the provided information (viewer's name, their message, emotes, badge etc.). 

### Type of Twitch Triggers 

##### Chat or whisper message  
Listens to all chat messages and triggers when specific conditions are met.     
Will also listen to whisper messages if you use Twitch: Open Whispers command.    
All chat message triggers are case sensitive by default. You can uncheck `Case Sensitive` to allow all messages no matter the case.
