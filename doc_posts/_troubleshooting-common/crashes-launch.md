**Antivirus/Firewall**
Try allowing the app through your firewall and/or deleting `gmfile.dll` in your LioranBoard Receiver folder.

**Voicemeeter**
If you are running Voicemeeter, you need to launch it AFTER LioranBoard.\
Alternatively, the default output audio device needs to be set to the Voicemeeter virtual device.

**Faulty sound drivers**
You can try [reinstalling your sound drivers](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/fix-sound-problems-in-windows-10-73025246-b61c-40fb-671a-2535c7cd56c8).
