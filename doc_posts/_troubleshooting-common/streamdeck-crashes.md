**Outdated Stream Deck** 
Make sure you're using the latest version of Stream Deck. 

**Wrong IP/port**
If you press 'Connect' in your StreamDeck and can only see a black/green screen, it means it hasn't established a successful connection to the Receiver. The reason can be a wrong IP address/port, VPN or something else blocking the port.

**Wrong or corrupted deck files**
You can find your `config.ini` files in one of these locations: 
- lioranboard/LioranBoard Receiver
- C:/user/%username/appdata/local/lioranboard

Make sure your config.ini files are not skipping any numbers in the names. If you have `configs1.ini` and `configs3.ini`, you also need to have `configs2.ini`.
