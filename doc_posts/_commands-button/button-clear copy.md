title: "Block Button"
num: 3
---

Blocks a button by its ID or an entire Group ID.\
Won't cancel an ongoing button but will prevent any already existing queue from happening when its turn comes.\
The block does not persist when LioranBoard is restarted.\
By setting the ID to all you can remove all current blocks. This only works for unblocking buttons.
