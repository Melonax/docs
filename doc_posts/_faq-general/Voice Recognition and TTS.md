**Default Text to Speech**\
There's a default TTS extension when you install LioranBoard Notification System. Transmitter must run in a browser outside of OBS for the TTS to properly work.   

**Polly Text to Speech**\
I have created a more advanced extension Polly TTS which works with Transmitter running in OBS as a dock.\
You can download Polly TTS from Itch.io below, which is a popular platform for developers to host their indie games and tools.

**Voice Recognition**   
Not implemented as of now, however we're looking into adding it to LioranBoard 2, which is currently in progress!
