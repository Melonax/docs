You can use  [Block Button ]({{ "commands/button#blockbutton" | relative_url }}) command to temporarily block a button from executing.\
 If you enable `Allow Queue`, all the incoming triggers will be savely queued up and executed as soon as you use Block Button command again to unblock the button.\
This is extremely useful if you want to make sure you don't miss any alerts while you're on a BRB scene.
