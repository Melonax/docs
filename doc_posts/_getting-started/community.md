## Ways to contribute 
Interested in contributing to LioranBoard documentation or building an extension? Weâ€™d love your help! 

### Edit a page
Read through the documentation, and click the {::nomarkdown}<a class="btn btn-sm btn-edit-light mb-2 mb-md-0" href="https://github.com/LioranBoard/docs/edit/main/doc_posts/_getting-started/community.md" title="Click the button to edit this page!" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i class="fas fa-pen"></i> Edit</a>{:/} button if you see anything confusing or have any **suggestions** for something to be improved.

### Add your own button example
Want to **add your own button example** to any of the commands in the [Commands]({{ "commands/variables" | relative_url }}) section? Each command can have up to 3 different button examples!
1. First you will need a screenshot of the button uploaded to Imgur and [pastebin](https://pastebin.com/) with the button's [imported JSON]({{ "faq/receiver#shareabutton" | relative_url }}).
2. Click on {::nomarkdown}<a class="btn btn-sm btn-edit-light mb-2 mb-md-0" href="https://github.com/LioranBoard/docs/edit/main/doc_posts/_commands-number/variable_transition.md" title="Click the button to edit this page!" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i class="fas fa-pen"></i> Edit</a>{:/} button for the command you want to add an example to. Maybe you would like to add one to [Math: Random]({{ "commands/number#mathrandom" | relative_url }}) command?
3. Use this [very simple template](https://github.com/LioranBoard/docs/edit/main/templates/example_command_simple.md) which will produce this particular button: {% include example_public.html src="https://i.imgur.com/zsxdHym.jpeg" size="50" title="Simple button" pastebin="9HNbNCrN" desc=description %}

{:start="4"}
4. (optional) Like to experiment? Check out the [advanced template](https://github.com/LioranBoard/docs/edit/main/templates/example_command.md) instead which will produce this button:&nbsp;{% include example_public.html src="https://i.imgur.com/jydvLf6.jpeg" size="50" title="Advanced button" pastebin="9HNbNCrN" desc=description %} 

{:start="5"}
5. Add the code snippet from the template to the very end of the command you're editing on Github!
6. Scroll down to **Commit changes**, create a meaningful title and press `Commit changes` button. 
7. Wait for an approval for it to show live on our page!
