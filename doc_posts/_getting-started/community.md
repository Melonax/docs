## Ways to contribute 
Interested in contributing to LioranBoard documentation or building an extension? Weâ€™d love your help! 

Here's a few ways: 
- Read through the documentation, and click the {::nomarkdown}<a class="btn btn-sm btn-edit-light mb-2 mb-md-0" href="https://github.com/LioranBoard/docs/edit/main/doc_posts/_getting-started/community.md" title="Click the button to edit this page!" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i class="fas fa-pen"></i> Edit</a>{:/} button if you see anything confusing or have any **suggestions** for something to be improved.
- Want to **add your own button example** to any of the commands in the [Commands]({{ "commands/variables" | relative_url }}) section? Each command can have up to 3 different button examples!
 1. You will need a screenshot of the button uploaded to Imgur and [pastebin](https://pastebin.com/) with the button's [imported JSON]({{ "faq/receiver#shareabutton" | relative_url }})!
 2. Click on {::nomarkdown}<a class="btn btn-sm btn-edit-light mb-2 mb-md-0" href="https://github.com/LioranBoard/docs/edit/main/doc_posts/_commands-number/variable_transition.md" title="Click the button to edit this page!" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i class="fas fa-pen"></i> Edit</a>{:/} button for the command you want to add an example to. Maybe you'd like to add one to Math: Variable Transition command?
 3. Use this [very simple template](https://github.com/LioranBoard/docs/edit/main/templates/example_command_simple.md) which will produce [this particular button](https://lioranboard.ca/docs/templates/example-command-simple).\
    Like to experiment? Check out the [advanced template](https://github.com/LioranBoard/docs/edit/main/templates/example_command.md) instead which will produce [this advanced button](https://lioranboard.ca/docs/templates/example-command)!
 4. Add the code snippet from the template to the very end of the command you're editing on Github!
 5. Scroll down to **Commit changes**, create a meaningful title and press `Commit changes` button. 
 6. Wait for an approval for it to show live on our page!
- Have you made your own extension and would like to share it with the rest of the community? Contact our moderators on the official [LioranBoard Discord server](https://discord.gg/dXez8Zh) for the approval! All our released extensions are tested and checked for any harmful code. 
- Found a bug? Fill out a bug report either in our Discord channel or in the bug report section on this website! Please follow the guidelines to make it as easy as possible for us to track down the issue. <span class="badge bg-warning text-dark">Under construction</span>
